## Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features 

This repository contains the implementation of a Fashion Recommendation System leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze and recommend fashion items based on image features.

### Process Overview
- Data Collection: Assemble a diverse dataset of fashion items.
- Preprocessing: Standardize image format and resolution.
- Feature Extraction: Use a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16) to extract image features.
- Similarity Measurement: Compute similarities between feature vectors.
- Recommendation: Rank and recommend the most similar fashion items.

### Key Components
- Dataset: Collection of various fashion images.
- Pre-trained Model: VGG16 for feature extraction.
- Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity to compare features.
- Visualization: Display input image and top recommendations.
